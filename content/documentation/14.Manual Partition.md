# Manual Partition Installation Guide

Installing **TeaLinuxOS with manual partitioning** gives you full control over how your disk is set up.  
This is ideal for advanced users who want to:
Separate system and user data (e.g. custom `/home` partition)
Use different file systems like BTRFS or XFS

## Steps for Manual Partitioning

1. **Boot from the Installation Media**  
   Insert your TeaLinuxOS USB/DVD and boot your computer. Choose the option to start the installation.

2. **Choose Installation Type: Manual Partitioning**  
   On the partitioning screen, select the **Manual** option.

3. **Disk and Partition Setup**  
    You will see a list of your current disks and partitions. From here, you can:

   - Create new partitions (like `/`, `/home`, `swap`)
   - Choose mount points
   - Set file system types (e.g. EXT4, BTRFS)
   - Adjust partition sizes as needed

    <Alert title="Important" type="warning" message="If you click New Partition Table,all existing partitions on the selected disk will be erased.  This action is irreversible and will delete any data on that disk.  Use this only if you're sure you want to start fresh on that disk."/>

4. **SWAP Configuration**  
   If no dedicated swap partition is created, TeaLinuxOS can use **dynamic swap** by default.  
   You can still manually create a traditional swap partition if preferred.

5. **Review and Confirm**  
   Double-check the mount points and partitions.  
   Once you confirm, the installer will format and write to the selected partitions only â€” not the entire disk (unless you chose to overwrite it).

6. **Continue Installation**  
   After partition setup, the installer proceeds with the rest of the installation like timezone, user setup, etc.
