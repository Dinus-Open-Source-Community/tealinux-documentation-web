# User Creation

During the installation process, you will be asked to create a user account. This step sets up the main user who will log in and manage the system after installation.

You will be required to provide:

- **Full Name** – This is the display name for your user.
- **Username** – Used for login and file ownership.
- **Password** – Required for login and administrative tasks.
- **Computer Name (Hostname)** – Name of your device on a local network.

> **Tip:** Use a secure password containing a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Automatic Login

You can optionally enable **automatic login** for your user account.  
When enabled, the system will skip the login screen and log in directly to your desktop environment after booting.
