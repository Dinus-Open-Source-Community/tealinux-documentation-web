# Create the bootable media

After booting into TeaLinuxOS, you'll enter the **Live Session** — a fully functional desktop environment that runs directly from the USB stick (or DVD) without modifying your computer’s hard drive.

This session allows you to:

- Explore the look and feel of TeaLinuxOS.
- Test hardware compatibility (e.g., Wi-Fi, sound, display).
- Try out pre-installed applications and tools.

::alert{:type=warning :title="Note" message="ome applications available in the Live Session are temporary. Once you install the system to your hard drive, these apps may not be included by default and will be removed unless reinstalled manually."}

## Ready to Install?

If everything works as expected during the Live Session, you can proceed with the installation by clicking the **"Install TeaLinuxOS"** icon on the desktop or application menu. The installer will guide you through the following steps:

1. Language and keyboard layout selection.
2. Disk partitioning and formatting.
3. User account setup and password creation.
4. Final installation and reboot.

Once installed, TeaLinuxOS will run faster, and changes will persist across sessions — unlike the Live Session.

Enjoy your journey with TeaLinuxOS!
